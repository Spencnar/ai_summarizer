AI Summarizer
AI Summarizer is a ReactJS application that utilizes Vite for quick setup, Tailwind CSS for creating a responsive and visually appealing user interface with a touch of glass morphism. The application leverages the power of RTK Query to make advanced API requests that are conditionally triggered. Additionally, the application saves user history using local storage, handles form events, catches errors gracefully, and enables copy-to-clipboard functionality. The codebase is organized and follows clean coding practices.
